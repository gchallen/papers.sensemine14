\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec-conclusions}

We introduce \PhoneLab{}, a new large-scale programmable smartphone testbed
hosted by SUNY Buffalo. \PhoneLab{} provides a mixture of features designed
to enable the next generation of mobile systems research. Through five
vignettes based on data collected by a preliminary usage study, we have
demonstrated that \PhoneLab{} is useful and usable.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

A number of other SUNY Buffalo students have worked on the \PhoneLab{}
testbed, including Micheal Benedict, Vinu Charanya, Rishi Gupta, Jay Inamdar,
Manoj Mylapore, Mitchell Nguyen, and Sean Zawicki.
