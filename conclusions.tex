\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec-conclusions}

We have introduced \PhoneLab{}, a new large-scale programmable smartphone
testbed at the University at Buffalo supporting experimentation both above
and below the application-platform interface. Through three example
experiments we have demonstrated the power of \PhoneLab{} to enable the next
generation of mobile systems research. We look forward to working with
researchers interested in using \PhoneLab{} once the testbed opens to the
public in October, 2013.
