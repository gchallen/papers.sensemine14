As smartphones have emerged as the most significant large-scale mobile
platform in computing history, the scale of smartphone experimentation has
lagged behind. Keeping pace requires new facilities that enable
experimentation at scale to ensure that research discoveries translate to the
growing network of smartphone devices.

This paper introduces \PhoneLab{}, a 190~device smartphone testbed deployed
at SUNY Buffalo. \PhoneLab{} provides access to an incentivized group of
participants ready to engage in Android experimentation. The testbed will
open for public experimentation in January, 2013, and grow to over 700
smartphones by 2014.

% For initial abstract submission this number is estimated.

To demonstrate the power of \PhoneLab{} we present five selected results from
a usage characterization experiment run on 115 phones for 21 days. We use
each result to motivate a future \PhoneLab{} experiment, demonstrating the
power of \PhoneLab{} to enable mobile systems research.
