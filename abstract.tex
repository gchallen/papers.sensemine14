While smartphones have emerged as the most significant large-scale mobile
platform in computing history, the scale of smartphone experimentation has
lagged behind. New facilities that enable experimentation at scale are needed
to ensure that research discoveries translate to the growing network of
smartphone devices.

This paper introduces \PhoneLab{}, a 288-device smartphone testbed deployed
at SUNY Buffalo. \PhoneLab{} provides access to an incentivized group of
participants ready to engage in Android experimentation. The testbed will
open for public experimentation in October, 2013, and continually grow by 2014.

To demonstrate the power of \PhoneLab{} we present three selected results
from a usage characterization experiment run on 115 phones for 21
days~\XXXnote{GWA: Need to update these numbers.}. We use each result to
motivate a future \PhoneLab{} experiment, demonstrating the power of
\PhoneLab{} to enable mobile systems research.
