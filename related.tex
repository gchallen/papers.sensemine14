\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}
We discuss our related work in three categories---testbeds, measurement tools,
and smartphone measurement studies.

{\bf Testbeds:} Testbeds in other domains also have chosen their design points
to meet domain-specific needs. For example, PlanetLab~\cite{peterson:ccr:2003,
planetlab} operates more than 1,000 machines world-wide in order to enable
large-scale, realistic Internet research. Emulab~\cite{white:osdi:2002, emulab}
provides emulated network environments to enable controlled, repeatable network
experiments. MoteLab~\cite{werner-allen:ipsn:2005} targets realistic sensor
network experiments by deploying a sensor network testbed in a building at
Harvard. ORBIT~\cite{raychaudhuri:tridentcom:2005} takes a two-tier approach
allowing emulated experiments as well as real deployments, targeting
reproducibility and realism at the same time.

{\bf Measurement Tools:} Researchers have also developed special-purpose
measurement tools. These tools are designed to measure certain metrics such as
power consumption~\cite{zhang:codes:2010, pathak:eurosys:2012} or 3G
performance~\cite{huang:mobisys:2010}. Though we have developed a measurement
tool for our analysis as well, our focus for this paper is not the tool design,
but the power of \PhoneLab{}.

{\bf Smartphone Measurement Studies:}
\XXXnote{stevko: need to revise according to our findings.}
Though the primary purpose of our analysis is to demonstrate the power of
\PhoneLab{}, our findings complement what previous studies have reported. Falaki
et al.~\cite{falaki:mobisys:2010} are among the first ones to study smartphone
usage. Their central finding is that in many of the metrics they studied, there
was significant diversity without a clear pattern; the metrics include the mean
interaction length, the mean number of applications used, the mean amount of
traffic, etc. Xu et al.~\cite{xu:imc:2011} use a network-level trace to analyze
smartphone application usage. The key findings are that smartphone users use
many regional applications such as local news apps; certain applications are
installed together; and mobility patterns affect the types of applications
used. Trestian et al.~\cite{trestian:imc:2009} study users of a 3G network and
report a similar finding: people's movement and locations correlate with
applications they use. They also report that there is a correlation between
content upload and location in another study~\cite{trestian:ton:2012}. Shye et
al.~\cite{shye:micro:2009} studies how power consumption is distributed over
different hardware components. Kim et al.~\cite{kim:fast:2012} focus on
correlation between storage and application performance and find multiple
factors that affect application performance. Many studies have also looked at
WiFi and 3G network characteristics using
smartphones~\cite{keralapura:mobicom:2010, maier:pam:2010, gember:pam:2011}.
